# ThayerWebsite

I was approached by a first grade teacher near where I live who was made aware I was learning to code in my free time. She asked if I was able to make a single page website. I made a rough wirefrime of how I thought it would look, threw that design out and went with this final product. A relatively simple, yet in my opinion elegant, website.
