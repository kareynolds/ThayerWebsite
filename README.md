# ThayerWebsite

I was approached by a first grade teacher near where I live who was made aware I was learning to code in my free time. She asked if I was able to make a single page website. I made a rough wirefrime of how I thought it would look, threw that design out and went with this final product. A relatively simple, yet in my opinion elegant, website. It was the first time I was actually asked to make something for someone, and it was incredibly rewarding to see the various frameworks, tricks, and styles i've picked up on come to fruitition and actually be useful to someone.
